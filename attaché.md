Always wishing I grew up as a teenager during the [Crypto Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars), I am a guy in his late 20s who is overly enthusiastic about all things cyber/tech/infosec/electronics… or generally speaking “computers”. My professional career and personal hobbies allow my life to be filled with what I am passionate about. From playing around on my Dell PowerEdge r710 home lab running Proxmox, to working with like minded people to plan, develop, document, and execute technology based projects across an enterprise. Anything inbetween that that typically involve one or more of the following: [poi/glowstringing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_(performance_art)), video games, mathematics, science, criminal justice, philosophy, structure, [love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love), happiness, empathy, [learning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning), teaching, sharing, integrity, [respect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respect), loyalty, [perspective](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective), relaxing, and/or being human.

```

Since infancy I have been [disassembling]("https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/break") toys/tools/items that I find intriguingly entertaining. I do this for the opportunity of fixing them and thus teaching myself how/why they work. I have found that doing this fulfills my never-ending unconscious need for overcoming challenges and learning something new. It also subsequently allows me more opportunities to apply my knowledge in creative ways through innovations or improvements.
